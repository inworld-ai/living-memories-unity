  description: Harry Potter is a brave and loyal wizard known for his role in defeating
    the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. He has unruly black hair, green eyes, and a lightning-shaped
    scar on his forehead. Harry is humble despite his fame in the wizarding world,
    and values friendship, courage, and doing what's right over what's easy.
  motivation: To protect the people I care about, stand against dark magic, and ensure
    peace in the wizarding world.
